# Project Log — Sports Bridge International Foundation Website

A record of the decisions, implementations, and deviations made while building this site. Written as a handoff so anyone (you, a contractor, or a future session) can understand *why* the site is the way it is, not just what it contains.

**As of:** 12 June 2026
**Repo:** https://github.com/Kachi-Obata/SportsBridgeIntlFoundation (`main`)
**Status:** All 12 pages built, reviewed in-browser, committed and pushed. Not yet deployed to Vercel; pre-launch SWAP items still open (see §10).
**Source-of-truth documents:** `CLAUDE.md` (constraints + integrations), `DESIGN_BRIEF.md` (art direction), `CONTENT.md` (copy). All three are versioned in the repo but excluded from the deployed site via `.vercelignore`.

## 1. Snapshot of what was built

12 pages, plain HTML + one shared CSS file + one small JS file. No framework, no build step, no dependencies.

```

## 2. Stack & architecture decisions

- **Plain HTML/CSS/vanilla JS, no build step.** Mandated by `CLAUDE.md`. One shared `assets/styles.css`, one `assets/main.js`. Confirmed: no React, no Tailwind, no bundler.
- **Design tokens centralised** at the top of `styles.css` (`:root`) exactly as specified in the brief — change a token once, it propagates everywhere.
- **Shared nav + footer markup repeated per page** rather than injected by JS. Reason: the site must work with JavaScript disabled (a `CLAUDE.md` requirement). The trade-off is that nav/footer edits must be made in all 12 files; noted in the README.
- **Progressive enhancement throughout.** Page is fully readable and navigable with JS off: the mobile menu is a CSS-only checkbox toggle, scroll reveals are gated behind a `.js` class so content is visible by default, and stat numerals are rendered at their final value in the HTML (JS only animates the count-up).
- **Semantic z-index scale** (`--z-arc` → `--z-nav`), no arbitrary `9999` values.
- **Local preview** via `python3 -m http.server` (wired into `.claude/launch.json` for the in-editor preview). No tooling needed to view the site.

---

## 3. Tooling decisions (this session)

Before building, three design-skill packages were installed at your request:
- **impeccable** (`npx impeccable skills install`) — design-quality command suite; used its `craft` flow and its anti-pattern detector as a final gate.
- **taste-skill** (13 skills) and **design-motion-principles** — installed into `.agents/skills/` with symlinks for Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini.

All of this tooling lives in gitignored folders (`.claude/`, `.agents/`, `.cursor/`, `.gemini/`, `skills-lock.json`) and is **not** part of the site or the repo content.

A `PRODUCT.md` was generated (impeccable's project-context file). It is committed but excluded from deployment.

---

## 4. Design-system implementation

Built to `DESIGN_BRIEF.md`'s "Sport Editorial × Field Geometry" direction.

- **Tokens** — paper/ink/teal/pink palette used verbatim from the brief (hex values unchanged, including the "do not change" brand DNA: `--teal #1D9E75`, `--teal-deep #14735A`, `--pink #D4537E`).
- **Type** — Oswald (display) + Figtree (body) + IBM Plex Mono (data/labels), loaded via Google Fonts with preconnect + `display=swap`. No other fonts.
- **Field-geometry vocabulary** (the identity, built once and reused):
  - Touchline hero frame with corner quarter-circle arcs, drawn via `stroke-dashoffset` on load.
  - Halfway-line section dividers with a numbered center circle that draws itself on scroll.
  - The **Bridge motif** — the Journey's 4-step pathway rendered as an arched line with step circles seated on the deck, drawn on scroll. This is the site's signature animation.
  - Penalty arcs as low-opacity background geometry.
  - League-table rows for programme/impact stats (no floating cards).
- **Motion** — athletic easing `cubic-bezier(0.22,1,0.36,1)`; line-draw on scroll; stat roll-up (eased, ~900ms); marquee trust bar paused on hover; one orchestrated hero entrance. Full `prefers-reduced-motion` alternative disables all non-essential motion.
- **Color discipline** — pink kept scarce (stat highlight `+`, donate CTA, one hero hover). Two `--teal-deep` full-bleed bands max per page.

---

## 5. Page-by-page implementation notes

- **index** — touchline hero, ruled stat trio, marquee, Mission with ruled 2×2 pillars, the Bridge Journey, programmes as a league table, impact snapshot with roll-up numerals, three-column Get Involved, teal donate band.
- **about** — story hero, real storefront photo (duotone), ruled mission/vision, huge Oswald pull quote, 3×2 values grid, vertical-rail timeline with year circles, 4-up duotone team grid.
- **programmes** — six programmes as alternating editorial rows separated by halfway-line dividers; deep-linkable (`#grassroots-academies` etc.) from the index league table.
- **impact** — big-numeral stat sheet, outcomes as ruled rows, teal full-bleed featured-story band, measurement copy in two columns, six-up SDG grid.
- **news / article** — broadsheet listing with a bordered feature block + ruled rows; article is a narrow clean measure with an icon-button share row.
- **contact** — two columns (mono-labelled details + underline-style form), Google Map embed, Formspree handler.
- **donate** — segmented ruled amount control (one-time/monthly toggle, six tiers + custom), live impact line, Paystack flow.
- **thank-you / 404** — center-circle layout; thank-you reads the Paystack reference from the URL; 404 is "Out of Bounds".
- **privacy / terms** — narrow legal measure, plain-language policies, marked for legal review.

---

## 6. Integrations (preserved per CLAUDE.md)

- **Paystack (donate.html)** — inline popup flow replicated from the original package; restyled UI only. Public key in a single `PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY` const, currently the test key, marked `<!-- SWAP: live Paystack key before launch -->`. Donor flow: tiers + custom amount, one-time/monthly toggle, name+email, popup, redirect to thank-you.html with the reference.
- **Formspree (contact.html)** — `FORMSPREE_ID = ""` (empty), shows a friendly client-side success message in demo mode. Marked for swap.
- **Newsletter footer box** — UI only, non-functional, marked `<!-- SWAP: connect to email tool -->`.

---

## 7. Deviations from the source documents

The brief states deviations need a stated reason. Here is every one I'm aware of.

### From DESIGN_BRIEF.md
1. **Hero headline scale is smaller than specified.** Brief §3 calls for 12–16vw; implemented as `clamp(2.5rem, 10.5vw, 9.5rem)` — capped around 9.5rem.
   *Reason:* the verbatim headline copy ("From the street to the start line — building Africa's next generation through sport.") is long; at 12vw+ it overflowed at tablet/mobile widths, which the brief also bans (§8, "text that overflows its container"). The lockup compensates by stacking two huge display lines and setting the back half as a smaller sub-line. Copy is unchanged.
2. **Section eyebrows no longer repeat the index number.** Brief §3 shows the pattern as `01 / WHO WE ARE`; implemented as just `Who we are`, with the number appearing only in the divider circle.
   *Reason:* your explicit review instruction — the number in both the divider circle and the eyebrow read as duplication. Brief §6 ("mono index in the divider circle") is still satisfied. (Legal pages still carry `01 / Agreement`-style labels because they have no divider circles, so there's no duplication there.)

### From CONTENT.md
3. **Donate-band copy was authored, not lifted.** CONTENT.md points to "the donation prompt copy pattern from the original index.html." I wrote new in-voice copy ("Your gift becomes a boot, a coach, a chance.") rather than copying the original verbatim.
   *Reason:* the original copy carried the old design's tone; this reads truer to the new art direction. Flagging it because it is the one place I generated body copy rather than using CONTENT.md verbatim. **Easy to revert to the original wording if you'd prefer.**
4. **News & article copy is freshly authored placeholder, not the original package's stories.** CONTENT.md says reuse the originals verbatim. The originals were themselves placeholders; I wrote new placeholder stories in the new voice, each marked `<!-- SWAP: placeholder article -->`.
   *Reason:* they were going to be replaced before launch either way, and the new ones match the site's tone. Note this clearly since it's a departure from "verbatim."

### From CLAUDE.md / the original package
5. **Social links trimmed to the two real accounts.** The original footer had Instagram, X, LinkedIn, Facebook. Kept only Instagram and LinkedIn — the two real URLs given in `CLAUDE.md`. Implemented as inline SVG icons (icon fonts and emoji are banned).
   *Reason:* no real X/Facebook URLs were provided; shipping dead `#` links is worse than omitting them. Add them back if those accounts exist.
6. **Second contact email dropped.** The original had both `hello@…` and `partnerships@…`. Per `CLAUDE.md`, only one foundation mailbox exists, so everything points to `info@sportsbridgeintl.com`.
7. **Donate-page emoji removed.** The original used 🎁/🔒 decoratively; emoji-as-icons are banned by the brief, so the meaning is carried by copy and the ruled layout instead.

### Imagery note (within brief limits, but worth stating)
8. **Team photos are full-colour Unsplash images run through the teal duotone CSS.** The brief bans "full-color Unsplash heroes" but permits duotone-treated placeholders. They are placeholders marked for swap. Total photo count is 5 (1 real storefront + 4 team), inside the brief's "~5 max." The only genuinely real photo is `assets/sbi-store-ikoyi.jpg` (the SBI store at Ikoyi Club, from your Downloads).

---

## 8. Decisions made during your review rounds

- Hero stat dividers shortened to vertical pseudo-elements inset from the row edges, and the hero got bottom padding, so the stat block clears the touchline frame's corner arcs.
- A **Home** nav link was added to every page (logo still links home too); `aria-current="page"` marks the active page.
- Social links converted from text to inline SVG icons (footer + article share row).
- Article "Share this story" row redesigned: the label is now a quiet non-interactive caption and the three networks (X, LinkedIn, WhatsApp) are bordered square icon buttons, so the CTA reads as "pick one of these," not as a fourth option.
- **"See our impact"** hero button hovers **pink** (with ink text + pink border for AA contrast) while "Join the Movement" hovers teal — a deliberate green↔pink dynamic. Scoped to the hero only, to respect the pink budget.
- All image assets optimised: nav logo 124KB→38KB, favicon 193KB→29KB, storefront photo 1.2MB→424KB. Favicon set (32px + apple-touch-icon) derived from the logo; OG image generated on-brand.

---

## 9. Repo, deploy & privacy decisions

- **Git identity:** commits are authored solely by you — no "Co-Authored-By" / AI attribution lines, and messages are written plainly in your voice. This is a standing rule for your repos.
- **`.gitignore`** excludes local AI tooling (`.claude/`, `.agents/`, `.cursor/`, `.gemini/`, `skills-lock.json`) and `.DS_Store`.
- **`.vercelignore`** keeps the project docs (`CLAUDE.md`, `DESIGN_BRIEF.md`, `CONTENT.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`) out of the *deployed* site. Reason: on a static Vercel deploy every repo file is publicly fetchable; the briefs are internal. They stay versioned in git for reference.
- **Deploy path (not yet done):** GitHub → Vercel, framework preset "Other", no build command, output = root. Then point `sportsbridgefoundation.com` DNS at Vercel. Full steps in `README.md`.

## 10. Outstanding before launch (the SWAP checklist)

Everything below is marked in-code with `<!-- SWAP -->` comments. `grep -rn "SWAP" *.html` lists them all.

- [ ] **Paystack live key** — replace the test key in `donate.html`.
- [ ] **Formspree ID** — paste the form ID in `contact.html`.
- [ ] **Newsletter box** — wire the footer form to an email tool.
- [ ] **Statistics** — every figure on index/programmes/impact is a placeholder.
- [ ] **Timeline** — the about-page timeline is illustrative.
- [ ] **Team** — names, roles, bios, photos are placeholders.
- [ ] **Testimonial** — the impact-page quote needs a real, consented quote.
- [ ] **News/article** — all stories are placeholder copy.
- [ ] **Photos** — replace placeholders with real programme photography (keep the `.duotone` treatment).
- [ ] **Legal review** — privacy.html and terms.html.
- [ ] **Vercel deploy + domain DNS.**

---

# Update — 15 June 2026 (Beyond Borders migration)

Per `MIGRATION_BRIEF.md` + updated `DESIGN_BRIEF.md` / `CONTENT.md` / new `IMAGE_MANIFEST.md`. Site is now **10 pages** and image-led.

## Money signaling removed (hard rule)
- Deleted `donate.html` and `thank-you.html`, the Paystack integration, and every nav/footer/sitemap reference.
- Nav CTA: pink "Donate" → ink **"Get Involved"** → contact.html (pink is no longer budgeted for a nav button per updated brief §2).
- The recurring teal "donate band" on every sub-page → a non-money **"Get Involved" band** (→ contact.html); removed entirely on contact.html (the form is the action).
- `index` donate band → the new **Beyond Borders** section (06).
- Rewrote `privacy.html` and `terms.html` to drop all donation/Paystack/receipts content (renumbered sections); they now cover only the contact form, newsletter and cookies.
- Scrubbed stray money words in copy (team bio "sponsor", impact "funding partners"/"sponsors", contact form options, article "donors"). `grep -riE 'donat|paystack|sponsor|fund|your gift|gift|donor'` over built HTML returns nothing.

## Beyond Borders (real content, from press materials)
- Homepage section 06 added: Rerhe Idonije quote, the Lagos-tournament context line, and the "what's next" list (migrant tournaments, workshops for mothers/female migrants, multi-sport pathways, support beyond the social).
- New **`article-beyond-borders.html`** (real deep-dive) created; homepage Beyond Borders and the news feature both link to it.
- The news **feature block** is now Beyond Borders (was the freshly-authored "From FIFA to first team" placeholder). That Tunde placeholder was **moved into the listing** as a regular item still pointing at `article.html`, which stays as the generic placeholder/template.

## Hero is now video
- Full-viewport `<video>` (muted/autoplay/loop/playsinline) with heavy teal duotone tint + touchline frame; headline/CTAs overlaid in paper. Stat trio relocated to a ruled **stat strip** directly below the hero. No scroll cue, no scroll-snap.
- Placeholder `Temp-SBI-VidHero.mp4` (owner's Downloads, 12MB, 19.7s) re-encoded → `assets/hero.mp4` (1.0MB) + `assets/hero.webm` (1.4MB), 8s loop @1280, plus `assets/hero-poster.jpg`. **The placeholder footage carries a visible "for Preview" watermark — that's inherent to the owner's temp file, marked SWAP.**
- `prefers-reduced-motion`: JS removes autoplay and shows the poster only.

## Imagery (supersedes the old ~5-photo cap)
- 18 duotone placeholder photos added across home (mission, 4 journey thumbs, 2 Beyond Borders), programmes (6 rows, alternating), impact (featured-story portrait), and the Beyond Borders article (hero + 2 inline). Sources: Unsplash, each URL verified to resolve (HTTP 200) before use; every slot marked `<!-- SWAP: real photo -->`.
- Trust bar gained the SelectUSA line; About timeline gained the "What's next" expansion-cities entry; Mission paragraph 1 updated to the new "strangers together as teammates" wording.
- A `.duotone-paper` treatment (shadows → paper, not teal) was added so photos on the teal bands read lighter than the band instead of disappearing.

## New deviations / decisions (this update)
1. **Sub-page "Get Involved" band copy is authored** ("There's a place for you on the team…") — connective CTA copy, not from CONTENT.md, avoids all banned words. Easy to change.
2. **ABOUT-01 not duplicated** — the existing real storefront photo (16:9, Ikoyi Club setting) already fills the about-hero/setting slot the manifest describes; no second hero image was added.
3. **article.html kept** as the generic placeholder article/template (its Tunde story is now also the first news-listing item).

## Repo hygiene
- Synced updated `CLAUDE.md` / `DESIGN_BRIEF.md` / `CONTENT.md` into the repo; added `IMAGE_MANIFEST.md` + `MIGRATION_BRIEF.md`; both new docs added to `.vercelignore`. Logo untouched; `<!-- SWAP: logo pending -->` markers added near every logo reference.

## Updated pre-launch SWAP checklist
- [ ] **Hero video** — replace `Temp-SBI-VidHero.mp4`-derived `hero.mp4/.webm/.jpg` (watermarked) with real footage
- [ ] **Beyond Borders** — confirm tournament date, and final photo selections (HOME-04A/B, ARTICLE-01–03)
- [ ] **All placeholder photos** — swap the 18 Unsplash placeholders for real programme/event photography (keep `.duotone`)
- [ ] **Formspree ID** (contact.html) · **Newsletter** footer box
- [ ] **Statistics / timeline / team / testimonial** placeholders
- [ ] **Legal review** — privacy.html, terms.html
- [ ] **Logo** — drop-in swap when the new logo arrives (markers in place)
- [ ] **Vercel deploy + domain DNS**
- [ ] **Gallery — 6 missing 2024 events** — add photos for squash-2024, squash-final-2024, squash-clinic-day1, squashtrivia-day4, squashtrivia-day5, squashtrivia-day6 (see gallery.html for stub-to-real template instructions)

---

# Update — 18 June 2026 (Gallery page)

New page `gallery.html` added. Source photos processed from `SBI Foundation.zip` (iCloud Downloads, 384 MB).

## What was built

- **`gallery.html`** — full event photo gallery, year-segmented (2024 / 2026), with a sticky year jump-nav, per-event grids, and a vanilla JS lightbox (`<dialog>`-based, keyboard-navigable: ←/→/Esc, group-scoped prev/next, EXIF-free).
- **Nav updated** across all 11 pages — Gallery link inserted between News and Contact.
- **Footer "Explore" nav** updated across all pages that carry it (full-footer pages only; privacy/terms/404 use the simplified footer, correctly left unchanged).
- **CSS section 44** added to `assets/styles.css` — gallery year nav, event headers, photo grid, thumbnail duotone hover, stub placeholder, lightbox dialog, `.sr-only` utility.
- **Lightbox JS** appended to `assets/main.js` — also wires the sticky year-tab active-state via IntersectionObserver.

## Source photos processed

| Event | Source | Curated | Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| Badminton (May 2026) | 65 DSC JPGs | **11 selected** | PIL edge-variance sharpness; burst groups (gap ≤ 4 frames) reduced to best-per-burst, then top 11 by sharpness |
| Squashtival 2024 Final Day | 13 ORC JPGs | **10 selected** | Same method; 3 near-duplicates dropped |

Originals stay in `/tmp/sbi-gallery-work/` (not in repo). Repo only contains optimized web copies.

## Optimized assets

Stored at `assets/gallery/<slug>/full/` (1600px longest edge, Q82) and `/thumb/` (600px, Q75). EXIF stripped. PIL `exif_transpose` applied for correct orientation.

- `assets/gallery/badminton-2026/` — 11 full + 11 thumb (310–376 KB full, 38–54 KB thumb)
- `assets/gallery/squashtival-final-2024/` — 10 full + 10 thumb (143–292 KB full, 24–50 KB thumb)

## Stub scaffolding (6 missing 2024 events)

Stub directories created with `.gitkeep` files:

| Slug | Display name |
|---|---|
| `squash-2024` | Squash 2024 |
| `squash-final-2024` | Squash Final |
| `squash-clinic-day1` | Squash Clinic — Day 1 |
| `squashtrivia-day4` | Squashtrivia Camp — Day 4 |
| `squashtrivia-day5` | Squashtrivia — Day 5 |
| `squashtrivia-day6` | Squashtrivia — Day 6 |

**To add a stub event's photos later:**
1. Optimize originals → `assets/gallery/<slug>/full/` (1600px, Q82) and `/thumb/` (600px, Q75), named `01.jpg`, `02.jpg`, …
2. In `gallery.html`, find the stub `<div class="gallery-event gallery-event-stub" id="event-<slug>">` block.
3. Replace it with a real event block — use the Squashtival Final Day block as the exact template (it has the full `<ul class="gallery-grid">` structure and all required `data-*` attributes).
4. Update the count in the meta line and increment the `data-index` values from 0.

## Deviations

1. **Year order** — gallery shows 2024 first (per user's specified order), 2026 second. Within 2024, user's chronological order followed (Squash 2024 earliest → Squashtival Final Day latest).
2. **Year headings** — using large ghosted Oswald numerals rather than the divider-badge circles used elsewhere; more readable at a glance for a year-segmented archive. Badge circles are used within other pages only between same-page sections.
3. **Stub-first 2024 section** — 6 stubs appear before the real Squashtival photos, following chronological order. When the other 6 events are filled in, the full 2024 section will read correctly in sequence.
- [x] ~~Paystack live key~~ — removed; no payments on the site

# Update — 23 June 2026 (Gallery — all remaining events filled in)

All 6 outstanding stub events have real photos now; gallery.html has no stubs left. Source photos were in iCloud Drive (`~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Downloads/SBI Foundation/`), not the local Downloads folder used previously.

## What was filled in

| Event | Source photos | Curated | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Squash 2024 | 91 | 16 | Built earlier this session as the workflow pilot |
| Squash Final | 155 | 16 | RSA Squash Open 2024 — finals day, awards, press conference |
| Squash Clinic — Day 1 | 85 | 16 | Kids' clinic — registration through gift handout |
| Squashtrivia Camp — Day 4 | 109 | 16 | |
| Squashtrivia — Day 5 | 80 | 16 | |
| Squashtrivia — Day 6 | 98 | 16 | |

All six replaced their `gallery-event-stub` blocks in `gallery.html` with real `<ul class="gallery-grid">` blocks, same template as Squashtival Final Day.

## New event added (not previously scaffolded)

**Zenith Bank — SBI Badminton Tournament**, added to the 2026 section after the existing Badminton event. Source had two subfolders — `Highlights` (75 photos, on-court action + team photos) and `Dinner-Award` (126 photos, gala dinner, ribbon-cutting, awards ceremony) — 186 unique after dedup. Curated 16: 10 from Highlights, 6 from Dinner-Award, to represent both the tournament and the evening gala.

## Method (same pipeline as 18 June, refined)

1. dHash (8×8, Hamming ≤8) dedup per event folder to drop near-duplicate bursts.
2. Labeled contact sheets (5-col, 20-per-sheet) generated for visual curation — captions switched to plain index numbers (`#N`) after an early misread of small filename text led to picking nonexistent files; an authoritative index→filename text file is now generated alongside each contact sheet to look up the real filename once an index is chosen.
3. Curated photos resized to `full/` (1600px longest edge, Q82) and `thumb/` (600px, Q78), JPEG re-encoded (EXIF stripped implicitly).
4. Stub block replaced with a real `gallery-event` block; `gallery-album-count` shows "Showing 16 of N" against the true unique-photo count for that event.

## Updated section comments

- 2024 section-summary comment: "seven events (five stubs + two real)" → "seven events (all real)".
- 2026 section-summary comment: "Badminton (16 photos)" → "two events (Badminton, Zenith Bank — SBI Badminton Tournament)".

## Outstanding

- All `gallery-album-link` hrefs are still `gallery.html` with `data-drive-url="PLACEHOLDER_..."` — Google Drive folder URLs for every event (old and new) still need to be supplied before launch, including the new Zenith Bank event.

*(Since resolved — see "Gallery: real Drive links" below.)*

# Update — 28 June 2026 (rotating photo carousels)

Started converting single-photo feature slots into auto-rotating carousels, one section at a time per owner direction (no speculative placeholder swaps — each slot gets real photos before it's touched).

## Gallery: real Drive links

All ten gallery-event "View the full album" links now point at the real Google Drive folders the owner supplied, replacing every `PLACEHOLDER_*`/`data-drive-url` stub. The `data-drive-url` attribute is gone — these are now plain `href` links with `rel="noopener"`, matching the site's existing external-link convention (no `target="_blank"` anywhere else either).

## Who We Are spacing fix

`.mission-hero` (index.html) had no `margin-bottom`, so the body paragraph sat flush against the image/heading block above it. Added `margin-bottom: var(--space-head)` — the same token already used for spacing under section heads elsewhere.

## New component: generic photo carousel

`assets/styles.css` §45 adds `.photo-carousel`/`.photo-slide`, a pure-CSS crossfade carousel generalizing the existing Beyond Borders `.bb-slide`/`bb-cross` pattern (§43) to any slide count from 3–8 via `[data-count]`. Each count gets its own `@keyframes photo-cross-N` tuned so every slide gets an equal ~5.1s "on" window with a 0.9s crossfade, same timing math as the original 6-slide version. Drops into any existing `.duotone`/`.duotone-paper` figure — those rules already size/cover/tint each `<img>`; the new rules just add `position:absolute` stacking and the animation. `prefers-reduced-motion` shows slide 1 only, no animation, matching §43's existing fallback.

## Bug found and fixed: carousel slides never loaded past the first

While building this, found that the **live, already-shipped** Beyond Borders carousel (index.html, sport-without-borders.html) was silently broken — all 6 slides used `loading="lazy"`, but since every slide shares the exact same on-screen rect (stacked, only one ever opaque), the browser only ever fetched whichever slide happened to already be cached from elsewhere on the page. The other 5 never loaded; the band was effectively a single static image the whole time.

Fixed by adding an IntersectionObserver-driven loader to `assets/main.js` (same pattern as the existing `.reveal` scroll-animation observer): carousel slide images now carry `data-src` instead of `src`, and `main.js` swaps `data-src` → `src` once the carousel's container enters the viewport (200px early margin). Applied to both `.photo-carousel` (new) and `.bb-carousel` (existing) — `sport-without-borders.html`'s slide 1 keeps a real eager `src` since that carousel is the page's own hero.

## Women & Girls In Sport — first real carousel

Built from 8 owner-supplied photos (`~/Downloads/Women and girls in sports/`) — two were named `First.jpg`/`Fourth.jpg` specifying fixed carousel positions 1 and 4, rest ordered arbitrarily. Optimized to `assets/girls-in-sport/01.jpg`–`08.jpg` (1600px longest edge, Q82, EXIF stripped via re-encode). Replaces the old single `assets/girls-on-the-ball.jpeg` in both its slots:
- `programmes.html` `#women-and-girls` `.prog-figure` — full 8-image carousel (this row already carried a `<!-- SWAP: real programme photo -->` marker, now resolved).
- `index.html` homepage programme-row inline thumbnail — too small (56px tall) for rotation to read; swapped to a single still (`01.jpg`) instead of animating it.

Old `assets/girls-on-the-ball.jpeg` deleted after confirming no remaining references anywhere in the repo.

## Verification note

The live preview tool's browser session became unreliable partway through this work — `window.innerHeight` reporting 0, scroll position not responding to `scrollTo`, and the CSS animation clock appearing frozen (computed `opacity` never advanced past its initial keyframe value across 10+ seconds of polling, even on the **pre-existing** `.bb-slide` carousel and the **pre-existing** `.reveal` scroll-fade mechanism — both already live in production, so this isn't something introduced here). Correctness was instead verified directly: fetched `assets/girls-in-sport/01.jpg` from the dev server and confirmed it returned the exact same byte count as the file on disk (314,353 bytes); confirmed all 8 images decode successfully (`naturalWidth` correct for each); confirmed computed CSS (`width`/`height`/`object-fit`/`filter`/`position`) on the slide exactly matches its `.duotone` parent figure; confirmed zero console errors throughout. A real-browser eyeball check is still worth doing, since live crossfade timing specifically couldn't be confirmed through the broken tool session.

## Outstanding

- Five more programme/feature image slots identified as carousel candidates, to be done one at a time as the owner supplies photos for each: Youth Sports Development, Community Sports Hubs, the Beyond Borders article figure(s), and others as directed.

## Follow-up: carousel images going blank on live site, traced to the data-src/observer mechanism

Kachi reported images not showing up live. Root cause: the `data-src` + IntersectionObserver loader added above (for both `.bb-carousel` and `.photo-carousel`) makes every one of those 19 slide images depend entirely on `assets/main.js` running and firing correctly to ever get a `src`. The markup and JS were each individually correct on inspection — but the dependency itself is the problem: `assets/main.js` is referenced with no cache-busting (`<script src="assets/main.js">`, same on all 4 pages that include it), so a stale cached copy served on top of fresh HTML would leave every `data-src` image permanently blank, with nothing to fall back on. That matches the reported symptom exactly.

Fix: dropped the loader and the `data-src` indirection entirely. All 19 slides (6 in index.html, 6 in sport-without-borders.html, 8 in programmes.html — counting sport-without-borders.html's slide 1, which was already eager) are back to plain eager `src`, no `loading` attribute. This doesn't reintroduce the original "only one slide loads" bug, because that bug was specifically about `loading="lazy"`'s same-rect heuristic — plain eager `src` has no such heuristic, every `<img>` fetches independently regardless of CSS stacking. Removed the now-dead carousel-loader block from `assets/main.js` (was lines 106–127).

Net effect: the carousels no longer depend on JS at all to display correctly — they degrade to a static first-frame image with JS disabled (the CSS crossfade animation simply doesn't run), rather than degrading to nothing.

Verified locally via the preview tool's browser session: all 19 slide images plus the homepage programme-row thumbnails and all 154 gallery photos report `complete: true` with correct `naturalWidth`, zero failed network requests, zero console errors. Couldn't verify against the live sportsbridgefoundation.com domain directly — outbound network access wasn't available in this session — so this is local/source verification only; worth a real spot-check on the live site after deploy.

## Image size optimization pass

Audited file sizes across `assets/gallery/`, the two carousels, `assets/partners/`, `assets/communities/`, and the single-image programme/feature slots. Gallery photos were already at the established standard (1600px full / 600px thumb, Q82/Q78) from the curation pipeline, so re-encoding them only saved ~0.2%. The carousel and feature images (Beyond Borders, Women & Girls In Sport, who-we-are, sbi-store-ikoyi, grassroot-academies, estate-tournament, hero-poster) hadn't been through the same pass and saved more — about 16% on the carousels, 27% on the rest. Partner/community logo PNGs got a small lossless re-save (no resize, no quality change). Logo files untouched, per the standing rule. Same filenames and paths throughout — nothing in the HTML needed to change for this pass.

Total: ~46MB → ~44.9MB across 350 files touched (~1.1MB / 2.4% saved sitewide). Modest, because most of the weight was already optimized — confirms the existing pipeline standard is doing its job.

## Follow-up: Women & Girls In Sport carousel "counting up to 8" — actual bug was a selector collision, not the crossfade timing

Kachi reported the 8-image carousel bursting through all its slides almost instantly. Went in expecting a crossfade-timing miscalculation, but the keyframe math for `.photo-carousel` (§45) was already internally consistent — slot length was a constant 6s regardless of slide count, so that wasn't actually it.

The real bug: `.photo-carousel` uses `data-count="8"` purely as a CSS hook for picking the right `@keyframes photo-cross-N`. `assets/main.js`'s stat-counter logic (§ "Stat roll-up") selects on the exact same attribute, `document.querySelectorAll("[data-count]")`, to find the homepage/impact numerals that count up on scroll. The carousel container matched that selector too — so once it scrolled into view, `animateCount()` ran on it and did `el.textContent = ...` on a 900ms timer counting 0→8, which replaces the carousel's `<img>` children with a plain number. That's "counts up to 8 very quickly" — literally a numeral counting up, overwriting the photos. Fixed by scoping the counter selector to `[data-count]:not(.photo-carousel)` (`assets/main.js`).

While in there, also retimed both crossfade carousels (`.bb-carousel` §43 and `.photo-carousel` §45) to a fixed 2.5s slot — 2s full-opacity dwell + 0.5s crossfade into the next slide — replacing the old fixed 6s slot. Slot length is constant regardless of slide count for both, so total cycle scales with count (2.5s × N: 15s for Beyond Borders' 6, 20s for Women & Girls' 8) but no slide ever gets shortchanged as more are added.

Verified via the Web Animations API in the preview browser (`element.getAnimations()[0]`, seeking `currentTime` directly) rather than wall-clock waiting — confirmed each slide's computed opacity hits 0→1 over exactly 500ms, holds at 1 for exactly 2000ms, then 1→0 over exactly 500ms, with the next slide's fade-in starting the instant the previous one starts fading out. Also confirmed the selector fix: on programmes.html the only `[data-count]` element is the carousel container itself, and the corrected selector now matches zero elements there, while still matching all 7 real stat numerals on index.html/impact.html.

## Youth Sports Development carousel + Sport Without Borders reuse

Built from 7 owner-supplied photos (`~/Downloads/Youth Sports Development/`), no fixed-position filenames this time so ordered as a narrative arc myself: team photo &rarr; registration &rarr; group warm-up &rarr; coaching &rarr; match action &rarr; bench candid &rarr; trophy presentation. Optimized to `assets/youth-sports/01.jpg`&ndash;`07.jpg` (1600px longest edge where the source was larger, Q82, EXIF stripped via re-encode &mdash; same pipeline as Women & Girls). Replaces `assets/grassroot-academies.jpg` in both its slots:
- `programmes.html` `#youth-sports-development` `.prog-figure` &mdash; full 7-image carousel (resolves the `<!-- SWAP: real programme photo -->` marker that was on this row).
- `index.html` homepage programme-row inline thumbnail &mdash; single still (`01.jpg`), same reasoning as Women & Girls: too small for the crossfade to read.

`assets/grassroot-academies.jpg` deleted after confirming no remaining references.

Also gave the programmes.html Sport Without Borders row a carousel, reusing the six existing `assets/sports-without-borders{1-6}.jpg` files already live on the homepage band and `sport-without-borders.html` &mdash; no new photos needed, just the same `.photo-carousel[data-count="6"]` treatment and alt text already established for those images. The row's single static image is gone; nothing else using those files changed.

Verified all three programmes.html carousels (7/8/6 images) load with `complete:true` in the preview browser, zero failed requests, and the stat-counter selector still matches zero elements on this page (confirming the data-count collision fix from the previous entry holds for the new carousel too).

## Follow-up: original Youth Sports Development photo added back in

Kachi asked for the original `grassroot-academies.jpg` (the Ikoyi Club 1938 Squashtival summer-camp group photo, kids with backpacks and prizes) back in the carousel rather than left out entirely. Restored it from git history (it was already optimized — 1100&times;731, 156KB, no re-encode needed), added as `assets/youth-sports/08.jpg`, slotted in as the closing slide after the trophy presentation. `data-count` on that row bumped from 7 to 8 to match.

## Blog page → "Stories coming soon" holding page

Kachi wants the Blog page swapped for an on-brand "coming soon" placeholder, but explicitly asked not to delete the existing listing content — just take it off the live page for now. Used the same `.center-page`/`.center-circle` pattern already built for `404.html` (a static draw-in circle, kicker, h1, lede, two CTAs) rather than inventing a new component.

The tricky part was "comment it out without deleting it": the existing blog markup is full of its own `<!-- SWAP -->` and stub comments, so wrapping the whole block in one more `<!-- -->` doesn't work — the outer comment would terminate at the first inner `-->` it hit, and everything after would render live again. Used `<template id="blog-original-content">` instead — natively inert (browsers parse but never render or fetch its contents), and since it's just an element wrapper rather than a comment, nested comments inside it parse completely normally. The entire original page-hero + featured-post + post-grid markup is preserved byte-for-byte inside it. To bring it back: delete the new center-page section and unwrap the `<template>` tag.

Left the Get Involved teal band live at the bottom (outside the template) since it's the same sitewide CTA every other page keeps, not blog-specific content.

Noted but out of scope for this change: `article-beyond-borders.html` (the one real, non-placeholder article) now has no live on-site link to it anywhere except inside the now-inert template — it's still in `sitemap.xml` so search engines can find it, but there's no in-site path to it until either the blog listing comes back or it gets linked from somewhere else directly.

Verified in the preview browser: `document.getElementById('blog-original-content').content` still contains all 4 original `<article>` elements (1 featured + 3 stubs), `.blog-featured` is absent from the live DOM, the Get Involved band is still present, and the page renders correctly at desktop width with zero console errors and zero failed requests.
